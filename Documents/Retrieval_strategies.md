# Retrieval Strategy for OmegaAI

## Overview
OmegaAI's **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** mechanism is a key aspect of its architecture, enabling the model to generate responses that are not only contextually rich but also factually accurate. The retrieval strategy combines **semantic vector retrieval** with **structured knowledge retrieval**, resulting in a **hybrid retrieval mechanism** that leverages both unstructured and structured data. The retrieval strategy is orchestrated through the **Memory Integration for RAG (MIR)** module and the **Modular Transformer with Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval (MTHR)**. This document details the different retrieval components, their interactions, and how they contribute to the overall functionality of OmegaAI.

## Retrieval Components
### 1. Semantic Vector Retrieval
**Semantic Vector Retrieval** is responsible for retrieving information from unstructured data sources, such as large document corpora. This is done using embeddings, which represent data in a high-dimensional vector space, allowing OmegaAI to find semantically similar information based on the context of the user query.

- **Embedding Generation**: The user query and the available corpus are converted into high-dimensional embeddings using pre-trained models (e.g., BERT or similar).
- **Similarity Search**: The embeddings are compared using distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) to find the most relevant documents or paragraphs.
- **Use Cases**: This approach is highly effective when the information is spread across long texts or when precise structured data is not available.

### 2. Structured Knowledge Retrieval
**Structured Knowledge Retrieval** retrieves specific data points from structured databases or knowledge graphs, allowing OmegaAI to provide accurate, factual responses.

- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: OmegaAI integrates with knowledge graphs that store information in a structured format with entities and relationships. This allows for quick retrieval of specific facts, definitions, or data points.
- **SQL-Based Queries**: For accessing relational databases, structured queries (e.g., SQL) are used to extract the exact data points required to answer the user query.
- **Use Cases**: This method is beneficial for providing precise answers, such as statistics, definitions, or any type of entity-based information.

### 3. Hybrid Retrieval Mechanism
The **Hybrid Retrieval Mechanism** combines both **semantic vector retrieval** and **structured knowledge retrieval** to provide a comprehensive response that leverages both context-rich and factually accurate information.

- **Parallel Retrieval Process**: The hybrid retrieval process occurs in parallel, where the query is simultaneously used to retrieve semantically similar content and structured data.
- **Information Fusion**: Once both retrieval types are complete, the retrieved content is fused together by the **Modular Transformer with Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval (MTHR)**. This ensures that the generated response incorporates both deep contextual understanding and verified factual data.

## Memory Integration with Retrieval (MIR)
The **Memory Integration for RAG (MIR)** module enhances the retrieval strategy by incorporating both **episodic** and **semantic memory** to provide continuity and depth in responses.

- **Episodic Memory Retrieval**: During a conversation, OmegaAI stores recent interactions in episodic memory. When a user query is received, MIR retrieves relevant parts of this short-term memory to maintain context and ensure continuity.
- **Semantic Memory Retrieval**: Semantic memory stores domain-specific knowledge and long-term facts that OmegaAI has accumulated during training. MIR retrieves relevant information from semantic memory to provide a rich and knowledgeable response.

## Retrieval Flow
1. **Query Sharding with QLCS**: When a query is received, it is first broken down into smaller, logical shards by the **Quantum-Like Context Sharding (QLCS)** module. Each shard represents a distinct aspect of the query and is processed independently.
2. **Shard-Level Retrieval**: Each shard is sent to the **MTHR** module, which performs hybrid retrieval for that shard. The **semantic vector retrieval** and **structured retrieval** processes occur in parallel.
3. **Memory Integration**: The **MIR** module is invoked to retrieve any relevant episodic or semantic memory related to each shard. This helps in maintaining continuity for ongoing conversations and adding depth to the response.
4. **Fusion and Generation**: The retrieved information from hybrid retrieval and memory integration is fused together by MTHR. The transformer blocks within MTHR generate a response for each shard, incorporating both contextual and factual information.
5. **Shard Consistency Check**: The **Shard Consistency Module** ensures that all shard responses are coherent, logically connected, and aligned in terms of context.

## Retrieval Strategies and Optimization
### 1. Query Classification
- **Shard Classification**: Each shard is classified to determine whether it requires **semantic retrieval**, **structured retrieval**, or both. This ensures that the most appropriate retrieval method is used based on the nature of the query.
- **Adaptive Retrieval Strategy**: Depending on user input and requirements, OmegaAI can adaptively decide which retrieval strategy to emphasize. For instance, if a factual response is needed, structured retrieval may be prioritized.

### 2. Hierarchical Retrieval Levels
- **Document-Level Retrieval**: For broad user queries, OmegaAI first retrieves entire documents that are likely to contain relevant information.
- **Paragraph and Sentence-Level Retrieval**: For more precise responses, OmegaAI drills down to the paragraph or sentence level to find the most relevant information. This hierarchical approach helps balance the depth and breadth of retrieved content.

### 3. Knowledge Validation
- **Cross-Referencing with Knowledge Validator**: Once the retrieved information is used to generate a response, the **Knowledge Validator** module cross-references the generated content with the retrieved data to ensure factual accuracy.
- **Error Handling**: If inconsistencies or gaps are found during the validation, the hybrid retrieval process is repeated to fill those gaps, and the response is refined accordingly.

## Retrieval Pipeline Examples
### Example 1: General Knowledge Query
- **User Query**: "Tell me about the Great Wall of China."
- **Retrieval Process**:
  - **Semantic Vector Retrieval**: Retrieves general context from document corpora about the Great Wall of China.
  - **Structured Retrieval**: Pulls specific data such as construction dates and length from a knowledge graph.
  - **Fusion**: MTHR combines these to generate a response that includes both detailed descriptions and factual data points.

### Example 2: Technical Query with Continuity
- **User Query**: "What is the latest version of Python, and how does it compare to the previous one?"
- **Retrieval Process**:
  - **Semantic Retrieval**: Retrieves contextual information about Python's features and improvements.
  - **Structured Retrieval**: Uses knowledge graphs to extract the version numbers and comparison metrics.
  - **Memory Integration**: Episodic memory is used if the user had previously asked about Python, ensuring continuity in the response.
  - **Fusion and Generation**: MTHR generates a response that provides both specific version details and a contextual comparison.

## Conclusion
The retrieval strategy of OmegaAI is designed to ensure that responses are both rich in context and accurate in content. By combining **semantic vector retrieval**, **structured knowledge retrieval**, and **memory integration**, OmegaAI can efficiently handle a wide range of user queries. The **hybrid retrieval mechanism**, coupled with the **self-reflective learning capabilities** of OmegaAI, ensures that users receive the most relevant and accurate information in an easily understandable format.
