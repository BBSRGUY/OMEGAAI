Below is a high-level description of the ray diagrams for the data flow within the QMSM-RAG architecture, which can be represented in the `data_flow_diagram.png` file. The diagrams depict the interactions between different modules in a visual format:

### 1. **Input Sharding Flow (Quantum-Like Context Sharding)**
- **Diagram Type**: **Ray Path Splitting Diagram**
  - **Description**: Visualize how an incoming user query is split into different shards using the QLCS. Show multiple arrows diverging from the input, representing the breakdown of complex queries into smaller shards.
  - **Flow**:
    - Input Query → QLCS → Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3…

### 2. **Shard-Level Processing (MTHR & Retrieval)**
- **Diagram Type**: **Ray Intersection and Integration**
  - **Description**: Represent how each shard is processed individually through different MTHR modules and how hybrid retrieval is performed. The diagram should show parallel paths representing each shard being processed by comprehension, retrieval, and generation modules.
  - **Flow**:
    - Shard 1 → MTHR (Comprehension, Retrieval, Generation)
    - Retrieval → Semantic Vector Retrieval & Structured Retrieval → MTHR

### 3. **Memory Integration (MIR)**
- **Diagram Type**: **Ray Combination with Memory Nodes**
  - **Description**: Show arrows connecting to **episodic memory** and **semantic memory** nodes, indicating memory retrieval. Draw arrows flowing back into the main shard-processing streams, depicting the integration of memory into the shard responses.
  - **Flow**:
    - Shard Processing → Memory Integration → Episodic & Semantic Memory → Enhanced Shard Response

### 4. **Self-Reflective Loop (SRLM)**
- **Diagram Type**: **Reflective Feedback Loop**
  - **Description**: Illustrate the self-reflective loop that runs after the initial response is generated. Use circular arrows to depict the iterative feedback and refinement cycle.
  - **Flow**:
    - Generated Response → SRLM Evaluation → Feedback Loop → Refined Response

### 5. **Shard Consistency and Integration**
- **Diagram Type**: **Ray Convergence Diagram**
  - **Description**: Depict how all the independently processed shards are integrated into a single cohesive response. The diagram should show multiple arrows (representing each shard) converging into a single output.
  - **Flow**:
    - Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3… → Shard Consistency Module → Integrated Final Response

### 6. **Final Formatting and Memory Update**
- **Diagram Type**: **Branch and Update Flow**
  - **Description**: Show the formatting flow, where the integrated response is processed through the **Formatter Module**. Add branches that represent **style adaptation** based on user requirements. Also, illustrate how the **episodic memory** is updated with the interaction.
  - **Flow**:
    - Integrated Response → Formatter Module → Styled Final Response
    - Integrated Response → Episodic Memory Update

These diagrams provide an intuitive understanding of the interactions between different components and data flow within the OmegaAI architecture. If you have any preferences for further elaboration or specific visualization requirements, let me know!
